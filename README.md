#Make an API call to find the geo-location coordinates of the International Space Station to receive latitude and longitude. Provides a link to insert the latitude and longitude to find the space station in relationship to the earth and makes a request to find out how many astronauts are on the space station and their names at the time you are checking location. Kind of fun to find out where the Space Station is and who is orbiting up there.
